# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a way to write code that organizes data and behavior into reusable, self-contained units called objects. Think of objects as real-world things, like a car or a dog, that have properties (like color or size) and actions (like driving or barking). OOP makes code easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.

In JavaScript, OOP helps you create objects to represent things and define what they can do. The main principles of OOP are:

### Encapsulation: Grouping related data and functions together and controlling access to them.

### Inheritance: Allowing one object to inherit properties and behaviors from another to reuse code.

### Polymorphism: Letting different objects perform the same action in their own way.

### Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts to make code simpler.
